I decided to abonden Vestige.wtf because I'm leaving the community soon. Being here was a waste of time, and I want to stay away from the negative people who don't respect themselves. Plus, I haven't made any money from the website, so I'm letting the domain expire on May 6th, 2023.

Vestige.wtf is in no way in shape or form associated with YesCheatPlus (Former Developer of Vestige Client).
